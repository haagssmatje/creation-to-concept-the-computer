   	   	<p>The computer we know today is the result of almost 250 years of concepts, tests and prototypes, which makes it hard to pinpoint exactly when it came into existance. It has been made and remade. From fitting in a whole room to fitting in your pocket, or even on your wrist. <br /><br />

   	<h2>The Analytical Engine</h2>

  	</figure>
   	<p>English mathematician Charles Babbage (considered by some to be the father of the computer) conceives of a steam-driven calculating machine that would be able to compute tables of numbers. It was named the Ananlytical Engine. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.</p>

   	<h2>The Turing Machine</h2>
   	<figure>
   		<img src="../Time line/Images/turing machine.jpg" alt="Alan Turing's Turing machine">
  	</figure>
   	<p>Alan Turing presents the notion of a universal machine, later called the Turing machine, capable of computing anything that is computable. The central concept of the modern computer was based on his ideas.</p>

   	<h2>The Z3</h2>  
   	<figure>
   		<img src="../Time line/Images/z3 machine.jpg" alt="The Z3 machine">
  	</figure>
   	<p>The Z3 was a German electromechanical computer designed by Konrad Zuse in 1935, and completed in 1941. It was the world's first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer. The Z3 was built with 2,600 relays, implementing a 22-bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 4â€“5 Hz. Program code was stored on punched film. Initial values were entered manually. The Z3 was completed in Berlin in 1941. It was not considered vital, so it was never put into everyday operation.</p>

   	<h2>The first single-circuit board</h2>

  	</figure>
   	<p>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak start Apple Computers on April Fool's Day and roll out the Apple I, the first computer with a single-circuit board, according to Stanford University.</p>

   	<h1>1983</h1>
   	<h2>The first PC</h2>
   	<figure>
   		<img src="../Time line/Images/macintosh.jpg" alt="The Macintosh">
  	</figure>
   	<p>Apple's Lisa is the first personal computer with a GUI (GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE). It also features a drop-down menu and icons. It flops but eventually evolves into the Macintosh.
	The same year saw the rise of the laptop. The Gavilan SC is the first portable computer with the familiar flip form factor and the first to be marketed as a "laptop."</p>

   	<h2>The 'first' smartphone</h2>   
   	<figure>

  	</figure>	
   	<p>IBM Simon is a handheld, touchscreen PDA designed (IBM), and manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric. The Simon Personal Communicator was the first personal digital assistant or PDA to include telephony features. The battery lasted only an hour, and flip phones became increasingly slim which led to its demise.</p>

   	<h2>The second first smartphone</h2>

  	</figure>
   	<p>Steve Jobs introduces the iPhone to the world. It brings many computer functions to the smartphone, 15 years after the first prototype of the smartphone. It was revolutionary in more than one way. It forever changed the way we view and share information and made life without touchscreen unimaginable.</p>

      Computers have grown smaller over the years, but their power has only grown larger. They have become smarter and more dynamic. This means that the design for these machines has had to grow with it.
